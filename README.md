This is the [relsett/herdr-auto-title](https://github.com/relsett/herdr-auto-title)
fork with an optional thread-title-only mode. See [FORK.md](FORK.md) for its
changes and update policy; install this fork to keep those changes.

A [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) plugin that names your tabs and panes after the
work in them. It reads the session twice a second, and it leaves alone any tab
or pane you rename yourself.

## Install

You need Herdr 0.8.2+ and Go 1.24+ on macOS, Linux or Windows. Herdr builds the
plugin from source when it installs it.

```sh
herdr plugin install relsett/herdr-auto-title
herdr server stop   # closes the session; `herdr` brings it back
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Herdr starts plugins only when its server starts, so nothing is renamed until
> you stop the server. Reopening the terminal attaches a new client to the same
> server and does not help.

If you use Claude Code, also run `herdr integration install claude`. Without it,
a session you opened with a slash command and never prompted stays `claude`.

## What you get

```
~/work/dashboard                       →  1 · dashboard
~/work/dashboard on feature/MC-13200   →  2 · dashboard › MC-13200
nvim editing auth.provider.ts          →  3 · nvim › auth.provider.ts
an agent working on OAuth scopes       →  4 · dashboard › claude › Implement OAuth scopes
ssh into prod-01                       →  5 · ssh › prod-01
$HOME                                  →  6 · Shell
```

- The number in front is the tab's position, which is also the key that
  switches to it.
- The default branch is left out. Other branches are cut down to what
  identifies them: `bugfix-asa-cpanel-uapi-mc-13675` becomes `MC-13675`.
- A tab with several panes is named after the focused pane, a pane with a busy
  agent, or the pane that changed last.
- Each pane gets a name of its own, so Herdr's goto panel (`prefix`+`g`) no
  longer lists every Claude Code pane as `claude`.
- Rename a tab or a pane yourself and Auto Title stops touching it. Clear the
  name to hand it back.
- On Windows, Herdr reports only the shell or an agent running in a pane, so an
  editor or an ssh session does not name its tab.

> [!WARNING]
> The first start renames every pane, including panes you had already named by
> hand. A pane you rename after that is left alone.

## Configuration

Every setting is optional. Copy [`config.env.example`](config.env.example) to
`herdr-auto-title/config.env` in your configuration directory and uncomment
what you need. Auto Title looks in these, in order, and uses the first that
already holds the file:

| Order | Directory                                                        |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` when it is set to an absolute path            |
| 2     | `~/.config`, which is `%USERPROFILE%\.config` on Windows         |
| 3     | `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS, `%APPDATA%` on Windows |

So `~/.config/herdr-auto-title/config.env` works on every platform, Windows
included, and one dotfiles repository serves every machine. A file already
sitting in `~/Library/Application Support` or `%APPDATA%` keeps being read
where it is.

Auto Title reads the file once at startup, so run `herdr server stop` after a
change. It does not read the config directory that `herdr plugin list` prints.

| Setting                         | Default                                  | What it does                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_DEBUG`        | `false`                                  | Log at DEBUG instead of INFO                                       |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_POLL_MS`      | `500`                                    | How often the session is read, in milliseconds                     |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_MAX_LENGTH`   | `50`                                     | Longest title, in columns                                          |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_BRANCH_MAX`   | `12`                                     | Longest branch in a title, in columns; `0` hides branches          |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_POSITION`     | `true`                                   | Put the tab's position in front of its title                       |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_MANUAL_FILE`  | `manual-names.json`, found the same way  | Where names you set by hand are kept; empty keeps them in memory   |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_TRANSCRIPT`   | `true`                                   | Read Claude Code's transcript: what an agent is doing, and where     |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_AGENT_NAME`   | `true`                                   | Put the agent's name in front of what it is doing                  |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_PANES`        | `true`                                   | Name panes as well as tabs                                         |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_PREFER_AGENT` | `false`                                  | Name a tab after its agent pane even while another pane is focused |
| `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_TITLE_ONLY`   | `false`                                  | Use only the thread title; omit position, directory, branch and agent |

`HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_TITLE_ONLY=true` removes surrounding title quotes and one
known directory suffix from Codex terminal titles. Actual agent titles and
transcript topics keep their text. An agent without a usable title is named
`New thread`; a pane without an agent is named `Shell`. This mode also applies
to pane names and overrides `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_POSITION`.

Turning `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_TRANSCRIPT` off also drops the branch from a tab whose
agent is working in a git worktree, because the transcript is what says which
worktree that is.
